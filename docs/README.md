1. [Abstract](#abstract)

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for studying complex systems and decision-making processes. This research contributes to the advancement of Agent-Based Modeling by proposing a transformative extension to the Mesa Python framework, specifically designed to enhance decision-making in ABM environments. Acknowledging the framework's current limitation of not supporting three-dimensional (3D) environments, our study focuses on smoothly integrating Triangular Meshes into Mesa. This integration aims to boost the framework's spatial simulation capabilities, which are essential for accurately representing complex surfaces and terrains in decision-making scenarios. Our objectives include exploring integration strategies, validating through case studies, implementing Triangular Mesh integration, evaluating performance, and extending the solution for scalability and generalization. The proposed software package targets decision-makers using ABM, providing an enhanced representation of spatial dynamics applicable in environmental simulations, structural engineering, and astronomy. Subsequent sections offer a thorough overview of our methodology, results, and implications, illustrating our efforts to empower the Mesa Python framework for more effective decision support in Agent-Based Modeling.

2. [Introduction](#introduction)

   Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) stands as a powerful methodology for comprehending the intricacies of complex systems and decision-making processes. ABMs simulate how individual entities, or agents, interact and behave in a given environment, offering valuable insights for informed decision-making. However, the effectiveness of ABMs relies on how accurately the environment is represented. Mesa Python framework, historically limited to two-dimensional (2D) spaces, faces challenges in handling the complexities of three-dimensional (3D) scenarios.

This research aims to overcome Mesa's 2D limitations by proposing a significant upgrade for spatial simulations in 3D environments, with a particular emphasis on the implementation of Triangular Mesh. Despite Mesa's essential role in ABM, contributing significantly to simulation studies[1], its inherent lack of native 3D support poses constraints in scenarios requiring detailed 3D representation.

The motivation for this upgrade stems from a recognized gap in the existing literature, highlighted by Patel's influential work in 2019 [2]. Patel emphasizes the need to expand Mesa's class structure to include (x, y, z) positions for agents, addressing the current limitation of Mesa's HexGrid grid, which only accommodates (x, y) positions. This extension proves crucial for achieving more realistic simulations, introducing a 3D-like modeling grid.
