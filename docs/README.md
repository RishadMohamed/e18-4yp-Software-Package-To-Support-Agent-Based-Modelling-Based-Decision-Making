Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for studying complex systems and decision making processes. However, most existing ABM software packages are limited in their ability to represent and analyze spatially heterogeneous and dynamic environments. This project aims to develop a novel software package for ABM based decision making that incorporates triangular meshes for realistic and flexible representation of surfaces and terrains. The software package is built on top of Mesa, an open-source ABM framework in Python. The project presents the design and implementation of the triangular mesh extension, which consists of four main components: 1) the triangular mesh class, which stores the agents and their locations in a 3D array; 2) the triangular agent class, which defines the attributes and behaviors of the agents in 3D space; 3) the triangular visualization server, which renders the triangular mesh and the agents using WebGL and Three.js; and 4) the triangular visualization browser page, which allows the user to interact with the model and control the simulation parameters. The project demonstrates the functionality and usability of the triangular mesh extension by applying it to two case studies: one on the spread of infectious diseases in a 3D cityscape, and another on the formation of flocking patterns in a 3D airspace. The project compares the results of the triangular mesh-based ABM with those of the conventional 2D grid-based ABM and validates the accuracy and performance of the proposed extension. The project concludes with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the triangular mesh extension and the potential applications of triangular mesh-based ABM in various domains. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of ABM methodology and software development and demonstrates the benefits of using triangular meshes for spatially explicit and dynamic modeling.

   In our exploration of the intersection between agent-based modeling (ABM) and decision-making within the realm of software packages, we delved into existing research and case studies to understand the landscape of tools and methodologies. Focused on the integration of triangular mesh technology, we aimed to identify gaps and opportunities for enhancing decision-making processes in ABM. Our literature review encompassed a range of sources, including academic databases such as ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus. Utilizing search terms such as "software package for agent-based modeling" and "decision-making in ABM," we scrutinized publications dated between 2014 and 2022 that aligned with the objectives of our research.

The selection of publications was guided by the relevance of their case studies and the incorporation of decision-making aspects within ABM. Following this approach, we meticulously examined 16 case studies that met our criteria. These cases were scrutinized based on specific parameters to evaluate their contributions to the field. Our assessment criteria includeds.

The environment or domain where the ABM-based decision-making experiments were conducted.

Research Objectives
The purpose and goals of the research, with a focus on decision-making within ABM.
Software Tools Employed
The software packages or tools utilized for agent-based modeling and decision-making.
Incorporation of Triangular Mesh
Identification of how triangular mesh technology was integrated into the ABM for decision-making.
Validation and Evaluation Methods
The strategies employed to validate and evaluate the outcomes of the ABM-based decision-making experiments.

The identified gap in our research involved the incorporation of triangular mesh technology within the context of ABM-based decision-making. Triangular meshes, well-established in various fields, can provide a detailed representation of complex surfaces or terrains. We identified their utility in diverse domains, such as geographical modeling, environmental simulations, structural engineering, astronomy, and computer graphics.

The potential of triangular meshes to enhance the precision and realism of ABMs was highlighted through their ability to model intricate landscapes, predict fluid dynamics for environmental management, analyze stress distribution in buildings, map celestial bodies, and contribute to realistic 3D models in computer graphics. Recognizing this gap in the existing literature, our research aims to bridge it by proposing and exploring the integration of triangular mesh technology in software packages dedicated to ABM-based decision-making.
