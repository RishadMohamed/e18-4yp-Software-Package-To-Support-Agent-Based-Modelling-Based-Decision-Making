**Introduction**
Agent-based modeling (ABM) offers advantages in studying complex systems by simulating the behaviors and interactions of autonomous entities over time. The Mesa framework was developed to address a void in Python for easily building and serving ABMs over HTTP. Unlike widely used frameworks like NetLogo, Mesa prioritizes scalability and execution speed, providing a flexible tool for academia and the private sector. The paper discusses Mesa's design goals, architecture, usage, applications, and outlines future development directions. Mesa can be installed via "pip install mesa" or downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa).

**Mesaâ€™s Design Goals** 
Mesa, designed for rapid agent-based model development in Python, prioritizes accessibility and extensibility. With a permissive Apache 2 license, it aims to be user-friendly like NetLogo and extensible like Mason. Focused on core functionality, Mesa encourages users to develop and share components through open source ecosystems. It leverages the Python and JavaScript ecosystems, integrating with data science tools. While not initially high-performance, some improvements, like a multi-processing batch runner, have been made. The philosophy "Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast." guides Mesa's development, and future enhancements may include multicore processing. Mesa's advantages lie in Python accessibility and its architecture allowing easy component replacement.

**Architecture and Usage**
Mesa, written in Python, adopts a decoupled structure influenced by Django, comprising three key components: Model, Analysis, and Visualization. The Model defines agents, space, and activation controllers, while the Scheduler handles agent activation, offering unique scheduling options. The Space component includes continuous, grid, and network spaces. Model Analysis involves DataCollector for data recording and BatchRunner for efficient parameter sweeps. Model Visualization offers both headless and browser-based visualization using HTML5, Bootstrap, D3, and others. Front-end technologies are continuously updated, and Tornado serves models to browsers. Standardization for model creation includes project layout, dependencies, and command-line tools. Mesa encourages sharing models, using virtual environments, and maintaining clean code through tools like Flake8 and Black. The framework prioritizes ease of understanding and flexibility.

**Applications and Extensions of Mesa**

Since its release, Mesa has been widely adopted across various domains, with over 50 cited papers and 250 GitHub repositories listing Mesa as a requirement. Applications span economics, biology, infrastructure, workplace dynamics, and more. Extensions showcase Mesa's extensibility, including Mesa-Geo for geospatial support and projects like Simulation Occupancy based Agents (SOBA) for building occupancy simulation. Modifications include integrating Mesa into Django-Channels with leaflet maps (Heinz, 2017) and creating extensions like Bilateral Shapley and Multi-level Mesa (Pike, 2018). Mesa's versatility is evident in its diverse applications and the development of specialized extensions by the community.

**Conclusion**
The paper concludes by emphasizing the introduction of Mesa, a Python framework for agent-based modeling, addressing the lack of such a framework in the Python ecosystem. It outlines Mesa's design goals, model architecture, and practical usage, showcasing its success through community adoption and extensions. The authors express the belief in Mesa's continued evolution driven by community contributions. Areas for potential improvement in Mesa include exploring multithreading and distributed processing, enhancing the data collector's scalability, expanding front-end modules, and considering the addition of 3D grids. The paper anticipates the growth of a community around Mesa, contributing packages that extend its functionality, such as Mesa-Geo, and domain-specific extensions like SOBA.
